h1. TXP Tweet

This is the development version of TXP Tweet, a collection of Textpattern plugins for Twitter integration.

TXP Tweet consists of two plugins: arc_twitter (the core Textpattern-Twitter integration plugin) and an optional arc_twitter_intents plugin.

* arc_twitter allows a Textpattern site to push and pull tweets from Twitter
* arc_twitter_intents extends arc_twitter by adding access to the Twitter web intents

The latest stable release can be obtained from the "TXP Tweet's homepage":http://andy-carter.com/txp/arc_twitter.
